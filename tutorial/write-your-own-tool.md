# Writing your own Web Analytics script
{: .no_toc }

## Prerequisites
- JavaScript Knowledge: Understand the basics of JavaScript, especially DOM manipulation. Familiarity with asynchronous programming and callbacks.
- Beacon API: This is used for sending data asynchronously to a web server without waiting for the server's response.
- Web Analytics Basics: Have a basic understanding of web analytics concepts such as page views, events, conversions, bounce rate, etc.
- Data Privacy and Anonymization: Understand the importance of user privacy and how to handle and anonymize user data.

## Technology Stack:

- JavaScript: For client-side tracking.
- Beacon API: For sending data to the server asynchronously.
- Server-Side Technology: For receiving and processing analytics data.

## Approach

1. Identify what data is to be sent

2. Identify how frequently should the data be sent

3. Attaching event listeners to the events, and capturing the required data

4. Creating a script to send data payload using Beacon API

5. Batching up events to avoid frequent data transmission

6. Have a error handling mechanism

7. Establishing server to receive the data and perform processing like user segmentation

8. Wrapping all the client-side script in a library

## Implementation
