# How does Web Analytics works?
{: .no_toc }

Web analytics tools operate by gathering information about user behavior. To gather this data, these tools utilize a code snippet, commonly referred to as a tag, that is implemented on each page of a website. This tag captures details such as the user's device type, browser, and geographical location, determined by analyzing the user's IP address. Additionally, it also captures user interactions with the website like page load, page unload, time spent on a page, product views, cart checkout, etc. Certain analytics services employ cookies to track individual sessions and identify repeat visits from the same browser.

While web analytics tools are generally proficient in data collection, they aren't flawless. Some users delete cookies, and diverse browsers impose varying restrictions on code snippets, potentially leading to slight variations in results across different analytics platforms.

> Browser plugins like AdBlocker and Ghostery block web analytics by interfering with the normal functioning of tracking scripts and tags embedded on websites.
